# pastemyst v2 ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/codemyst/pastemyst-v2/CI) [![Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298510542535000065/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/SdKbcbq)

this is the repo of the second version of [pastemyst](https://paste.myst.rs). it's in a separate repo because it's already messy in the main one and the second version is a huge rewrite and brings a lot more features. eventually this repo will end up as the master branch of the original repo once it's finished.

this is pretty much how the end result will look (at least for the home page), some of the new features are:

* multi file pastes
* accounts
* bookmarking
* better editor
* more languages
* labeling / categorizing
* private pastes
* editing
* deleting
* ability to set the default language
* linking to specific line / line ranges
* creating pastes from the command line
* and more stuff...
